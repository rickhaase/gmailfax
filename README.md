Tips:

Create a Dedicated Gmail Alias for Faxes
Instead of using your primary Gmail address, set up an alias (e.g., yourname+faxes@gmail.com). Link this to your online fax service. This keeps your fax-related emails separate from personal or work messages without needing a second account, and you can filter them into a specific Gmail label for easy access. 

Use a Custom Notification Sound for Fax Emails
After linking your fax number to Gmail via an online fax service, set up a filter in Gmail to identify incoming fax emails (e.g., by the sender’s domain like “@efax .com”). Assign a unique notification sound through your phone’s Gmail app settings or a third-party email app. This way, you’ll instantly know when a fax arrives without checking constantly. 

Auto-Archive Non-Fax Emails to Highlight Faxes
Configure Gmail filters to automatically archive or mark as read any email that doesn’t come from your fax service. This keeps your inbox clean, making incoming faxes (delivered as PDFs from the service) stand out as the only unread messages. 

Leverage Google Drive for Instant Fax Backup
Set up a Gmail filter to forward incoming fax emails to a service like IFTTT or Zapier, which can automatically save the attached PDF to a designated Google Drive folder. This ensures your faxes are instantly backed up and organized without manual effort. 

Schedule a Weekly Fax Digest
If you don’t need to see faxes immediately, use your fax service’s online portal (most offer this) to send a weekly summary email to your Gmail with all received faxes compiled into one message. Pair this with a Gmail filter to label it “Fax Digest” for a clutter-free inbox. 
Color-Code Fax Emails with Gmail Stars
In Gmail, create a filter that applies a specific star (e.g., red for urgent faxes, yellow for regular ones) to emails from your fax service based on keywords in the subject line (like “urgent” or “fax received”). This visually prioritizes faxes at a glance. 
Test Your Setup with a Dummy Fax Regularly
To ensure your fax-to-Gmail pipeline stays reliable, send yourself a test fax monthly using a free online fax tool or a friend’s fax-capable service. This confirms your number and email integration are working, avoiding surprises when it matters.
